# Panda's Blueprints
A server-side mod that adds blueprints to Minecraft.

## Features

### Reinforced Scaffolding
Like normal scaffolding, but made of copper. Can extend twice as far as normal scaffolding without falling. As it oxidizes, the distance becomes shorter. Be careful to not stand under it if it falls!

### Blueprints
Surround a blueprint table in scaffolding (normal or reinforced), and right click with an empty blueprint to copy a build to an empty blueprint! 
Placing it in another empty blueprint table will let you see a ghost version of your build, so you know how to recreate it!

By right clicking a filled blueprint, it also tells you how which blocks are needed to build it!

### Hard hat
Using armadillo scutes, you can make a hard hat, which protects you from attacks from above! It also deflects all damage from falling blocks. You can also dye it any color!

### Wrench
Use copper to craft a wrench, which lets you rotate blocks! You can also use it to rotate the display of a blueprint table.
